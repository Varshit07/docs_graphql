Customise schema with views
===========================

You may want to customise your GraphQL schema to:

- Limit scope i.e. expose only a subset of the columns in a table
- Fetch derived data (*aggregations like count, average, etc.*) in queries

These use-cases can be supported using database views.

Please see the following pages for the above use-cases:

- :doc:`../queries/control-access`

- :doc:`../queries/aggregations`
