Customise schema with views
===========================

You may want to customise your GraphQL schema for reasons like:

- Limit scope: expose only a subset of the columns in a table
- Fetch derived data (*aggregations like count, average, etc.*) in queries

Please see the following pages on how to support these use-cases using views:

- :doc:`../queries/control-access`

- :doc:`../queries/aggregations`
